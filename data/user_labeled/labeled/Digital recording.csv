Title Topic: Audio recording,
"
At the top of the page is a topic title. In the left column below, there are several topics that are related to the title topic in some way. 

What I need from you is to choose around 20 of the topics in the list below and indicate if it would be better to learn about that topic before or after you learn about the title topic.
indicate your answer in the column to the right (Before/After). It would also be helpful if your labels were relatively balanced, but not totally a requirement. 
(you are also welcome to do more than 20 if you like)
 
You will likely run into topics where it will be hard to decide. Choose just those topics you are most sure should come before or after.

Please don't spend more than 5 minutes on this! I don't want to take too much of anyone's time.

Thank you!",
